# optimized-read-across

In the present study, an optimized read-across method for the toxicity prediction of engineered nanomaterials is developed. The proposed method combines the analogue and the grouping approach using one or more similarity criteria. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that there is no need of prior grouping hypothesis to proceed with the predictions, as it is produced as an outcome of the method. The whole procedure is automated and only the balance between the level of predictive accuracy and the number of predicted samples is user-defined. The number of similarity criteria used in the analogues selection is also user-defined.   

The repository contains the main code for the read-across optimization as well as the necessary functions. The code was developed using Matlab<sup>TM</sup> however, it is compatible with GNU Octave. In the GNU Octave version, subtle changes (marked as comments) have been made to the original code for compatibility reasons.
